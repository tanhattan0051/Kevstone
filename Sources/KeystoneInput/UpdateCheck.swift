// UpdateCheck.swift — pure, testable core of the self-contained auto-updater
// (Phase 5, no Sparkle / no Apple Developer account). See DECISIONS.md
// "Auto-update (Phase 5, no Apple account)" for the full design.
//
// Everything in this file is a pure value type or a pure function: no
// networking, no filesystem, no `Bundle.main`. The app-layer glue that calls
// this (URLSession fetch, `NSAlert` prompts, unzip/relaunch via `Process`)
// lives in App/Updater.swift and is integration-only, same reasoning as the
// CGEventTap itself — see the existing "Integration-only" notes elsewhere in
// DECISIONS.md.
