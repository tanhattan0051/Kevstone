// RealisticTyping.swift — shared "what's actually on screen" test harness for
// suites that drive EngineController.handle and must model reality, not just
// replay edits.
//
// The real tap (EventTapController.handle) does two things per keystroke, in
// order: (1) inject the edit EngineController returns, synchronously, then
// (2) let the ORIGINAL physical key continue on to the app, but only when
// `suppress` is false. A harness that only ever applies step (1) is blind to
// step (2) — it cannot see a physical key EngineController failed to
// suppress land on screen, which is exactly the screen-desync bug fixed here
// (see DECISIONS.md "Suppress every character the engine took ownership of,
// even a no-op one"). `applyRealistically` below models both steps;
// `typeAndFlush` is the common "type a word, then Return" shape every
// EngineController-driven suite in this file needs.
//
// Shared by EngineControllerTests.swift, LexiconRestoreTests.swift and
// LexiconRealDictionaryTests.swift, which each used to carry their own
// edit-only copy of this loop.
